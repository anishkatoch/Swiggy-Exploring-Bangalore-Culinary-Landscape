**1. The maximum restaurant occupancy in Bangalore varies across different areas, with Indiranagar having the highest at 20.16%, followed closely by Btm Layout at 20.93%, and Koramangala at 16.09%.**

**2. 
The highest delivery review number indicates areas with restaurants that may have lower ratings. Considering these locations for opening a new restaurant can present an opportunity to attract customers seeking better dining experiences.**

**3. To ensure customer satisfaction, our focus will be on minimizing delivery time. Swift and efficient food delivery can significantly enhance the overall customer experience.**

**4. By analyzing the number of restaurants opened for each cuisine, we can identify popular cuisines in Bangalore. Incorporating these sought-after cuisines into our restaurant's menu can broaden our customer base and increase our restaurant's appeal. Offering a diverse range of popular cuisines can create a delightful dining experience for our customers.**
